Blurring of images is a predominant problem faced in hand-held photography. Several techniques exist for restoring the sharp image from the blurred picture. This
assignment revolves mainly around the problem of Image Restoration when the blur kernel is known. Some of the approaches used in this include full inverse, truncated inverse,
Wiener filter, etc. The quality of deblurring is also measured using metrics like PSNR and SSIM. Finally restoration of a new image is done by estimating the blur kernel from scratch.
