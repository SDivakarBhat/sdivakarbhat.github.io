## About

Currently a final year masters student in Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Bombay with specialisation in Control and Computing. I work as a Project Research Assistant under <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/" target="_blank">Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri</a> in <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viplab/" target="_blank">Vision and Image Processing Lab</a>. I work very closely with <a href="https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Biplab Banerjee</a> of Centre of Studies in Resources Engineering, IIT Bombay.  
My research interests include incremental learning, co-segmentation, few-shot/zero-shot learning and computer vision.
