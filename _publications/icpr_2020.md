## Abstract
     In this paper, we propose a novel framework for class agnostic co-segmentation of multiple images by generalizing to new classes given only a small number of annotated samples for each new class. We have developed a novel encoder-decoder network termed as DVICE (Directed Variational Inference Cross Encoder), which learns a continuous embedding space to ensure better similarity learning. We employ a combination of the proposed DVICE network and a novel few-shot learning approach to tackle the small sample size problem encountered in co-segmentation with small datasets like iCoseg and MSRC. Furthermore, the proposed framework does not use any semantic class labels and is entirely class agnostic. Through exhaustive experimentation over multiple datasets using only a small volume of training data, we have demonstrated that our approach outperforms all existing state-of-the-art techniques.
